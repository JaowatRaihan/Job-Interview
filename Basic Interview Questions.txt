#Introduce Yourself:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am Mohammad Jaowat Raihan. I graduated BSC in CSSE from AIUB in 2017. After graduation, I joined my
university software development department. I worked there as .net programmer. I worked there in two projects.
An ERP system and a mobile app. Currently I am looking for a better opportunity in your company.


#Why do you want to change the company
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have worked there more than two years and i realized that this is not the company i can work in longer. The culture 
there is not to explore technologies. For example, ASP.NET CORE 3.1 is available in the market. But stil, no one was from there 
interested switching newer technologies. Also, I don't see any new type of rojects innear future. And the salary package also not 
impressive to me. SO those are the reasons why i am trying to switch.


#Describe these projects 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ERP: This system is basically a Dairy Firms ERP. The firm is sister concern of AIUB. The system is developed
using ASP.NET WEB API in the backend along with SQL Server and AngularJS in the client side as a 
Single Page Application. And we used Telerik reporting as Reporting tool. I was responsible for getting requirements
from clients designing databases creating APIs and client side code to consume those APIs.

2.Mobile App: This mobile app titles "AIUB Portal". You can find Android version in play store. This is a hybrid Application.
We used ASP.NET API in the server side and Ionic4 in the client side. The users of this app is Students, Teachers & 
Employees of AIUB.In this app, a student can view course results, download notes, get notifications and view notices 
that are postedby faculty. A teacher can post notices upload notes and results. Teachers and Employees also view their 
daily attendances in this app.

#Why choosing Ionic4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So one day my boss told us we need to develop a new app for the university.It was my responsibility to choose technology for 
the app.I thought that we all are from c# background and doing native android and ios app has at least 6months of learning curve.
SO my team lead told me to suggest him hybrid technologies and I found Ionic a good match because it uses HTML,CSS,Angular which i 
already knew. So i suggested him this and he accepted it.
