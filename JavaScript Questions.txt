#foreach vs map/filter/reduce
    ->foreach: Iterate through each object preferable while printing data. If calculation or logic applied original 
               array will change
    ->map: Can be used when some calculation or logic applied into the data. Also it returns a new modified array and
           the original array stays that way.  
    ->filter: Filtering items from the array while keeping original array unchanged
    ->reduce: It returns the specific item in every iteration.
