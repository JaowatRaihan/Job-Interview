#Union vs Union all
    ->Union: Combine data from bultiple select statements in a single table but don't accept duplicate values
    ->Union all: Same as union but accept duplicate values

#Primary Key vs UniqueKey
    ->Primary key creates clustered key by Defult where UniqueKey creates Non Clustered
    ->Only one primary key per table where as many unique key can may created per table
    ->Primary key cannot have NULL where unique key may have NULL 
    ->But both can be a foreign key

#Window Function
    ->Used with Aggregate functions but it replaces group by statements.
    ->In group by we have single row for each group but in window function we can have same number of the rows of the group members.

#Joining
    ->InnerJoin: Join tables with common values
    ->Left Join: Take all the matched values first,then unmatched all the left table values
    ->Right Join: Take all the matched values first,then unmatched all the right table values
    ->Full Join: Join tables with or Without common values. Its a combination of left join and right join
    ->Self Join: Joining between columns of the same table.

#Constraints
    ->NOT NULL 
    ->UNIQUE 
    ->DEFAULT: Created using default keyword. Just like default values in JS ES6.
    ->INDEX
        -Clustered & NON Clustered Index
        -Both is used to make searching faster using B-tree
        -Without indexing, searching is slower
        -Clustered: Data stored in physical order, Change order of the data, Its faster than NON Clustered Only one per table
        -NON CLustered: Logical Order, does not order the data. More than one NON Clustered index per table one Index may contain more than ore columns.

#Delete vs Trucate
    ->Delete: Delete data of row/rows based on condition; DML command; Can roleback after deletion.
    ->Truncate: Delete data of entire table; DDL command; Can't roleback after deletion. Fatser than Delete

#CHAR vs VARCHAR2
    ->CHAR: If a column declared as CHAR(10) then it must contain exact 10 characters.
    ->VARCHAR2: If a column declared as VARCHAR2(10) then it may contain any number of characters till the size.

#Normalization
    ->1NF:
    ->2NF:
    ->3NF:

#Transaction
    ->Savepoint:
    ->Commit:
    ->Roleback:

#Trigger:

#Functions vs Stored Procedure
    ->If we need INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE; we must use Stored Procedure
    ->Stored Procedure returns zero or many variables where function must returns a value
