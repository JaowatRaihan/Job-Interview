#Union vs Union all
    ->Union: Combine data from multiple select statements in a single table but don't accept duplicate values
    ->Union all: Same as union but accept duplicate values

#Primary Key vs UniqueKey
    ->Primary key creates clustered key by Defult where UniqueKey creates Non Clustered
    ->Only one primary key per table where as many unique key can may created per table
    ->Primary key cannot have NULL where unique key may have NULL 
    ->But both can be a foreign key

#group by vs partition by

#Window Function - Over()

    ->Order by 
        -- Must provide
    ->Partition by --Optional
        --Optional
        --Divides the rows into partitions. Replacement of group by
    ->Range and Rows clause 
        --Optional
        --RANGE/ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING AND CURRENT ROW ..this this default
        --RANGE: Treat duplicate rows as One row
        --ROWS: Treat duplicate rows as Multiple rows
        --UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING : From start of the table..i.e: Firth Row
        --UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING : Last row of the table
        --1 PRECEEDING and 1 FOLLOWING: Previous row, current row, next row.

        --Difference between these three(When getting duplicate rows):

                RANK  ---------------- DENSE_RANK ------------------ROW_NUMBER
                
                  1                         1                           1
                  1                         1                           2

        --NTILE()
            ---Takes an integer argument that specifies how many parts or tiles the table have
            ---If the table has 10 rows, NTILE(2) Divides the rows into 2 parts..5 each
            ---If the table has 10 rows, NTILE(3) Divides the rows into 3 parts.. 4,3,3 each

    ->Value Window Functions

        --LEAD(column_name, offset, default_value)
            ---First Argument is mandatory
            ---Offset:Number of rows Above or Below
            ---Default: If now row found Above or Below, specify the default value
        --FIRST_VALUE(column_name)
            ---Returns column value of the first row
        --LAST_VALUE(column_name)
            ---Returns column value of the first row
            ---Provide RANGE or ROWS with UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING clause to get proper result. 

#Joining
    ->InnerJoin: Join tables with common values
    ->Left Join: Take all the matched values first,then unmatched all the left table values
    ->Right Join: Take all the matched values first,then unmatched all the right table values
    ->Full Join: Join tables with or Without common values. Its a combination of left join and right join
    ->Self Join: Joining between columns of the same table.

#Constraints
    ->NOT NULL 
    ->UNIQUE 
    ->DEFAULT: Created using default keyword. Just like default values in JS ES6.
    ->INDEX
        -Clustered & NON Clustered Index
        -Both is used to make searching faster using B-tree
        -One Index may contain more than ore columns.
        -Clustered: 
            --Data stored in physical order 
            --Change order of the data
            --Faster than NON Clustered
            --Only one per table
        -NON CLustered: 
            --Logical Order
            --Does not order the data 
            --More than one NON Clustered index per table 
        

#Delete vs Trucate
    ->Delete: Delete data of row/rows based on condition; DML command; Can roleback after deletion.
    ->Truncate: Delete data of entire table; DDL command; Can't roleback after deletion. Fatser than Delete

#where vs having
    ->Where cannot used in aggregate functions where having can
    ->Where calculate grou by statement before and having after. So from performance standpoint,
      where is better
    ->where comes before group by where having after  

#CHAR vs VARCHAR2
    ->CHAR: If a column declared as CHAR(10) then it must contain exact 10 characters.
    ->VARCHAR2: If a column declared as VARCHAR2(10) then it may contain any number of characters till the size.

#Normalization
    ->1NF:
    ->2NF:
    ->3NF:

#Transaction
    ->Savepoint:
    ->Commit:
    ->Roleback:

#Trigger:
    ->DML Triggers (Insert, update, delete)
        -After triggers (Sometimes called as FOR triggers)
            Example: 

            create trigger trigger_name
            on table_name
            for insert/delete/update
            as
            begin
                declare @id int
                select @id=id from inserted/deleted
                [inserted/deleted is a magic table that holds inserted/deleted row and only accecible to the current context of the trigger]
                [For update, inserted and deleted tables are used. inserted has updated row and deleted has old row]
                insert into table_name values
                (
                    
                )
            end

        -Instead of triggers
            Example:

            create trigger trigger_name
            on view_name
            instead of insert/delete/update
            as
            begin
                select * from inserted/deleted
            end
        
        -After trigger fires after data modification
        -Instead of trigger fires before data modification

    -DDL Triggers
    -CLR triggers
    -Logon triggers

#Cursor
    ->line by line looping
    ->@@FETCH_STATUS 
        --(0) - The FETCH statement was successful.
        --(-1) - The FETCH statement failed or the row was beyond the result set.
        --(-2) - The row fetched is missing.
        --(-9) - The cursor is not performing a fetch operation.

#Views
    ->View is a stored sql query
    ->View is also a virtual table
    ->We can use view for hiding rows or columns to give row/column level Security
        -Salary column is sensitive. We can create a view without the salary column. So salary is not exposed
        -Limit rows using where. Lets say only display IT departments data. So create a view and write rules in where clause 
    ->If there is a single base table, we can insert, update, delete into view
    ->For multiple tables in a view i.e:joins, we need instead of trigger to function properly
    ->Syntax:
        Create view view_name
        as
        select ..............
    ->Limitations of a View:
        -You cannot pass parameters to a view.Table Valued functions are an excellent replacement for parameterized views.
        -Views cannot be based on temporary tables

#Table Valued functions (Good replacement of VIEWS)
    ->Example:
        Create function function_name(@parameter nvarchar(20))
        Returns Table
        as
        Return 
        (Select * from table_name where parameter = @parameter)

#Functions vs Stored Procedure
    ->If we need INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE; we must use Stored Procedure
    ->Stored Procedure returns zero or many values where function must returns a value
    ->Function does not support output parameters

#Benifits of using Stored Procedure
    ->Reduce network traffic by sending few words rather than sending 50lines of code
    ->Re-usage the execution plan
    ->Resusability and Maintainability
    ->Security- by giving access only to stored procedure

#Eager loading and Lazy Loading



###T-SQL Syntaxes:

    ->OFFSET: 
        -Skipping row numbers
        -Order by clause required
        -Example: Suppose we want to develop pagination. So we can use like this:
            CREATE PROCEDURE spGetRowsByPageNumberAndSize
                @PageNumber INT,
                @PageSize INT
            AS
            BEGIN
                SELECT * FROM table_name
                ORDER BY column_list
                OFFSET (@PageNumber - 1) * @PageSize ROWS
                FETCH NEXT @PageSize ROWS ONLY
            END

    ->len() vs datalength()
        -len counts characters where datalength counts how many bytes
            declare @v int
            --declare @v nvarchar(max)
            set @v = 1 (output len=1, datalen=4)
            --set @v = '1' (output len=1, datalen=2)
            select len(@v),datalength(@v)

    ->REPLICATE(string, integer) 
        -Repeats a string a specified number of times

    ->CAST(value AS type) vs CONVERT(type, value)
        -Both used to converting value
        -CAST in general sql language where convert is SQL SERVER specific
            --SELECT CONVERT(int, 25.65).... ans: 25
            --SELECT CAST(25.65 as int).... ans: 25
    

    ->use [table_name or column_name] when the name is reserved keywords by sql server 

    ->create table #table_name vs declare @variable_name table
        -create a table in tempDB for both
        -for larger dataset, use create table where smaller data set use declare

    - <> Not equal to

    ->Replace(original_string, word_to_change, word_by_change)
        -REPLACE('It is a good tea at the famous tea store.', 'tea', 'coffee') result
            result = It is a good coffee at the famous coffee store.

    -Insert data from other table
        --insert into destination_table_name(column names) select (column names) from table_name 
                        [Here, destination table must be created before]
                                        OR
        --select (column names) into destination_table_name(column names) 
                        [Here, destination table created on the fly and must not create before]
